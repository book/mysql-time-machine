Revision history for MySQL-Time-Machine

Release 0.9.5  Date/Time: 2016-02-02

		[ENHANCEMENTS]
		- Restructured uuidBufer design, for better performance and adaptability
		  to two distinct load patters (many small transactions vs few very large
 		  transactions).
		- Refactored metrics code. Added additional metrics and clear naming for
          clear distinction between event-level counters and row-level counters
        - For updated rows store only the changed cells.
        - Added operation type markers: 'U' marker for updates, 'I' marker for
          inserts and 'D' marker for deletes. Markers are stored in column 'd:row_status'

		[MINOR ENHANCEMENTS]
		- Better naming for some variables and new constants added
		- shard number can be specified on startup as part of schema name

		[BUG FIXES]
		- Fixed regex for enum column definition parsing
		- handle Time2Column OpenReplicator type in type converter
		- For deleted rows all columns should be ignored (which was not the case).
